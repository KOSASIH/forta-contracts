   handle tech issues and find proper solutions. I believe that understanding
   of the technical part of any project is a valuable skill, hence Data Warriors would benefit from it as well.
   - Non-technical part: I love testing and empowering the quality of the
   product I am working on, hence I am trying to do my job as responsible and
   profoundly as possible.

I have been in the blockchain business since 2017 and started with ethereum mining and first investments. Since then, more and more different blockchain nodes and mining activities have been added which can be found below. 

I prefer to run my blockchain nodes in a professional virtualization environment. Here I prefer Proxmox. However, I also have advanced experience with Docker, Docker Compose and Docker swarm. I also have several years of experience in monitoring with Grafana and Prometheus. Load balancing and high IO database applications are also no longer a challenge since I added the graph to my portfolio.

I would be happy to be part of your journey. You can definitely expect quality infrastructure from me.

Im using several different infrastructure for other project. that is either bare-metal or vps solutions. for instance for Mina, im managing 3 physicals 32 core servers. two has been located in europe and 1 in Asia. 
I can easily extend my servers with adding new clusters or nodes. in long term plan, im planning to use automation (Ansible) to extend my server farm based on capacity and usage or i can write my automation scripts. 
generally im preferring to use python and bash scripts to manage my nodes. how ever, please check below link about my architecture and security

StakeCraft validator’s team consists of geeks with vast experience in developing and managing digital data and has a rich technical background. Everyone has been involved in crypto at least since 2017.
We have certificates from Cisco and Kubernetes and experience with Linux and cloud platforms for more than 5 years.
Our team has earned recognition in the crypto community as the reliable team that approaches with the highest responsibility for all tasks.
We are supporters of decentralization; we support projects by participating in consensus and actively participating in governance protocols.

We also actively participate in Testnets and take part in growing project communities as ambassadors.
Since we are focused on long-term and productive cooperation, we provide additional services for supported projects, for example, a snapshot service, relayers, etc.

We use Prometheus and Grafana for monitoring.
We also have our custom-made 24/7 real-time monitoring system, that operates from a separate secured environment.
We have our private discord channel where we track all updates in supported networks. So we implement updates almost immediately.
We’re always on alert.

In addition, I would like to say that our principles are to help decentralize the project network, and we are not chasing an instant profit.

Dear Forta team!
Hope you are doing well and Let me introduce myself!

* I am software developer and I am passionate about IT and Blockchain technologies. I took part in many testnets, where I got an experience about running and testing nodes for bugs. Also I have experience in full stack development. For a moment I take part in Ambassador programs of following projects: Firefly, Moonbeam, Joystream, Monox, Koii. At the moment I am looking for a great project where I can develop professionally. I am ready and able to contribute to the growth of Forta projects.
I am Testnet Moderator in Axelar and Recruiter and Moderator in Firefly.

* First of all, let me tell you about my experience in testnets.
I have experience in running and testing nodes in following projects:

- Concordium
- Meter
- Hopr
- Mina
- Secret Network
- Clover

* Invitational testnets:
I also participated in invitational closed testnets, according to interview results in the following projects:

- Bitcanna (1 of 50 testnet participants)
- Agoric (1 of 150 testnet participants)
- Parastate (1 of 50 testnet participants)
- Axelar  (1 of 100 testnet participants)
- Umee (1 of 200 testnet participants)
- Sanford (1 of 150 testnet participants)
- AssetMantle (1 of 100 testnet participants)

* My candidacy was choosen to be core validator in Cosmos Gravity Bridge!
Thats why I am going to attend Lisbon Cosmos cooference this friday! <3 and Also I participated as a guest in cosmoverse ceonference in Lisabon!

* During the testnet I am going to do my best to give you some advices from my side! I am going to study the project in as much detail as possible in order to give you as much benefit from my side. I am going to participate in bug bounties. 

* Some Additional info!
A little about how I set monitoring tools up and use them briefly!

Usually on dashboard of monitoring tool, I can track complete information about the server not only from the hardware side (CPU load, RAM, etc.), but also information about the last processed block of my node.
In other words, I can notice in real time that the server is loaded, but for some reason the node has lagged behind the network, not even turning on the server, but observing beautiful graphs in the browser =D.
Briefly speaking, I Install node-exporter on the server with the ""main"" node. It is a software that collects and exports metrics and statistics about the work of hardware on the server.
Then on another (monitoring) server that is ""processor"" node I install Prometheus and Grafana.
Prometheus pulls in and accumulates data from node-exporter, and Grafana renders it and gives me result, that I can inspect, to monitor all the data on ""main"" nodes server.
Screenshot of how it looks like =) - https://snipboard.io/EQjOv2.jpg
https://snipboard.io/zAT5lK.jpg

I have developed smart contract for the Parastate project so far. Here's a link. (https://github.com/ASergijenko/ParastateTestnet) At the moment, I am seriously immersed in the study of smart contracts and am looking for an opportunity to apply this knowledge, which I hope to find in the Forta project!

Speaking about my ambassador skills, I am going to do following things: 
- Create translations of Forta docs in latvian, russian, ukrainian languages;
- Create amazing motion design promo videos in after effects. For example promo of the project, to tell as many people as possible about the projects advantages.
- As I am co-founder of local crypto-community ""CryptoSailors"", I am going to make meeting with them to discuss, how we could help the project to grow.

This is a country in which operations with cryptocurrency and digital tokens are allowed. Here I work as an head of laboratory in the Minsk Research Institute of Radio Materials. We create complex chips for military needs and other semiconductor devices. From 2017, in his free time I am engaged in technology blockchain. It all started with simple trading and ICO. But later, I realized that it was better to deal with infrastructure for different projects and began to understand. At the moment I participated in different ambassador programs. For example: Moonbeam, COVALENT, MINA PRIZM, GRAPH PROTOCOL, InvArch, Yuser, KYVE, FLUX Protocol, Goldfinch, GOG. The Test networks were and there are many, but I probably list the main: xx.Network, NYM, MINA, Casper, Hopr, Clover. I want to be a part of your project to get a new experience, to participate in something innovative. I hope you will approve my candidacy, thank you and see you soon

On 2018, I have bought 7 GPUs to mine ETH and some random privacy coins based on Monero. The GPUs were mining for almost 1.5 years until I decided to sell it due to low return on 2019. I then switch to buy/sell crypto at this time. Then I encountered one of the promising crypto project on coinList, that was ALGORAND. I even managed to join the dutch auction sale on coinlist, though I only got a little bit of $ALGO. I manage to setup a Participation Node on my 7 year old laptop and was fascinated how fast it verifies a block or send an update (it was around ~4 seconds, which is pretty fast if you compare it to an existing network at that time.)

The second time I encountered on running a node was when I've ran a validator node on Oasis Network (the validator node is for Oasis-Ethereum ParaTime). Ran it for around 2 months using VPS I've rented on OVH but decided to dropped it since it requires lots of $ROSE token to break even the cost.

I've tried to look at the projects that would let community do some stress testing on their network and at the same time it gives you a reward. This project was one of it. Would be glad if I could be one of the test node runner.

Decentralization is also a very significant feature. the more nodes have the project, to more flexible it becomes to external risks, and more stable is the whole structure. I also know several very cool node operators, which can provide dedicated servers in many countries all over the world, which can help to provide more decentralized approach to node running process.

Mostly, I deploy nodes on dedicated servers hosted by Hetzner. Both in Germany and Finland. A few nodes are in France hosted by Vultr and Ikoula. I also, have a few spare servers located in Poland and hosted by Mevspace to be able to switch mainnet nodes there in case of problems with Hetzner.

All my nodes are covered by monitoring and automatic alerting. I use Grafana to have visibility on monitored metrics. It can be system metrics or project-specific ones. Mainnet nodes have capabilities to be quickly switched to standby servers in another datacenter.

My name is Yaraslau. I'm trust minimization maximalist. My primary field of work in crypto is technical writing and testnets, e. g. guides creation, FAQs, infographics and educational materials, nodes running and maintenance. 

The current projects I am involved in testnets by running a test node:
- Minima
- Massa
- Masa Finance

My stopped testnet nodes:
- IronFish

I have prepared various guidelines about Axelar, BitCanna, HydraDX, Medibloc, Mina, Osmosis, Sifchain, Solana and Stargaze projects. I'm collaborating with staketab.com staking provider team. You can find all of these guides at docs.staketab.com portal. I prepared almost all the content at this website.

I have experience in Running nodes for projects like NYM, Solana, UMEE. Currently I have active more than 40 different nodes( Aura network, Masa, Massa, Aptos, Starknet and etc)

I would be happy to become a part of Forta testnet and help it to grow. Everyday Im working with console and monitoring nodes via Grafana, so all of them are working perfect.

Really hope you guys revert to me with an answer and I can become a part of Forta ecosystem.",,#N/A,#N/A,,#REF!,,#N/A,,,
