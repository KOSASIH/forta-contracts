I took part in many testnets, where I got an experience about running and testing nodes for bugs. Also I have experience in full stack development. For a moment I take part in Ambassador programs of following projects: Firefly, Moonbeam, Joystream, Monox, Koii. At the moment I am looking for a great project where I can develop professionally. I am ready and able to contribute to the growth of Forta projects.\nI am Testnet Moderator in Axelar and Recruiter and Moderator in Firefly.\n\n* First of all, let me tell you about my experience in testnets.\nI have experience in running and testing nodes in following projects:\n\nActive mainnets:\n\n- Agoric: https://main.explorer.agoric.net/validator/agoricvaloper17cn500qdaqly0rqcp2alzewnggns997gq8l9s0 - (node name CryptoSailors)\n- Bitcanna: https://cosmos-explorer.bitcanna.io/validators/bcnavaloper1c8ugacy98lccx5p8zryfmrxypvesqkr9879p5f - (node name CryptoSailors)\n- Gravity Bridge: https://www.mintscan.io/gravity-bridge/validators/gravityvaloper1pske98rrpg6vwayjauncjqvfs6tj06xhmm9atm  - (node name CryptoSailors)\n- Umee AplhaMainnet: https://umee-internal-peggy-1-explorer.nodes.guru/validator/umeevaloper13vjf9sxz8sqvku3v4prctdlypdjls07qf8sj92 - (node name oxes)\n\nPreparing for Axelar Mainner: https://testnet.axelarscan.io/validator/axelarvaloper1lpx5tf2y42s9q39tmcqurukytlkcpwdtzkggev \n\nActive testnets:\n- Aptos\n- Anoma\n- Archway\n- Asset Mantle\n- Celestia\n- Comdex\n- Craft\n- Crescent\n- Chronic\n- DevxDAO\n- Gear\n- Humanode\n- Juno\n- Kira\n- Kyve\n- Moonbeam\n- OmniFlix\n- Passage\n- Solana\n- Uptick\n\nFinished projetcs:\n- Althea\n- Spacemesh testnet application\n- Casperlabs\n- Swarm\n- Moonbeam\n- Radicle\n- Concordium\n- Meter\n- Hopr\n- Mina\n- Secret Network\n- Clover\n\n* Invitational testnets:\nI also participated in invitational closed testnets, according to interview results in the following projects:\n\n- Bitcanna (1 of 50 testnet participants)\n- Agoric (1 of 150 testnet participants)\n- Parastate (1 of 50 testnet participants)\n- Axelar  (1 of 100 testnet participants)\n- Umee (1 of 200 testnet participants)\n- Sanford (1 of 150 testnet participants)\n- AssetMantle (1 of 100 testnet participants)\n\n* My candidacy was choosen to be core validator in Cosmos Gravity Bridge!\nThats why I am going to attend Lisbon Cosmos cooference this friday! <3 and Also I participated as a guest in cosmoverse ceonference in Lisabon!\n\n* During the testnet I am going to do my best to give you some advices from my side! I am going to study the project in as much detail as possible in order to give you as much benefit from my side. I am going to participate in bug bounties. \n\n* Some Additional info!\nA little about how I set monitoring tools up and use them briefly!\n\nUsually on dashboard of monitoring tool, I can track complete information about the server not only from the hardware side (CPU load, RAM, etc.), but also information about the last processed block of my node.\nIn other words, I can notice in real time that the server is loaded, but for some reason the node has lagged behind the network, not even turning on the server, but observing beautiful graphs in the browser =D.\nBriefly speaking, I Install node-exporter on the server with the \"main\" node. It is a software that collects and exports metrics and statistics about the work of hardware on the server.\nThen on another (monitoring) server that is \"processor\" node I install Prometheus and Grafana.\nPrometheus pulls in and accumulates data from node-exporter, and Grafana renders it and gives me result, that I can inspect, to monitor all the data on \"main\" nodes server.\nScreenshot of how it looks like =) - https://snipboard.io/EQjOv2.jpg\nhttps://snipboard.io/zAT5lK.jpg\n\nI have developed smart contract for the Parastate project so far. Here's a link. (https://github.com/ASergijenko/ParastateTestnet) At the moment, I am seriously immersed in the study of smart contracts and am looking for an opportunity to apply this knowledge, which I hope to find in the Forta project!\n\nSpeaking about my ambassador skills, I am going to do following things: \n- Create translations of Forta docs in latvian, russian, ukrainian languages;\n- Create amazing motion design promo videos in after effects. For example promo of the project, to tell as many people as possible about the projects advantages.\n- As I am co-founder of local crypto-community \"CryptoSailors\", I am going to make meeting with them to discuss, how we could help the project to grow.\nOur Announcements channel (https://t.me/CryptoSailorsAnn)\n\nLinks to my social media profiles and works:\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/channel/UCIzMGOgUEs6cGfaluWqNLTA\nhttps://twitter.com/cryptoalex6415\nhttps://cryptoalex6415.medium.com/\nhttps://github.com/ASergijenko\n\nLooking forward to hearing from you!\nWith pleasure, Aleksandrs Sergijenko\nP.S.

This is a country in which operations with cryptocurrency and digital tokens are allowed. Here I work as an head of laboratory in the Minsk Research Institute of Radio Materials. We create complex chips for military needs and other semiconductor devices. From 2017, in his free time I am engaged in technology blockchain. It all started with simple trading and ICO. But later, I realized that it was better to deal with infrastructure for different projects and began to understand. At the moment I participated in different ambassador programs. For example: Moonbeam, COVALENT, MINA PRIZM, GRAPH PROTOCOL, InvArch, Yuser, KYVE, FLUX Protocol, Goldfinch, GOG. The Test networks were and there are many, but I probably list the main: xx.Network, NYM, MINA, Casper, Hopr, Clover.

On 2018, I have bought 7 GPUs to mine ETH and some random privacy coins based on Monero. The GPUs were mining for almost 1.5 years until I decided to sell it due to low return on 2019. I then switch to buy/sell crypto at this time. Then I encountered one of the promising crypto project on coinList, that was ALGORAND. I even managed to join the dutch auction sale on coinlist, though I only got a little bit of $ALGO. I manage to setup a Participation Node on my 7 year old laptop and was fascinated how fast it verifies a block or send an update (it was around ~4 seconds, which is pretty fast if you compare it to an existing network at that time.)\n\nThe second time I encountered on running a node was when I've ran a validator node on Oasis Network (the validator node is for Oasis-Ethereum ParaTime). Ran it for around 2 months using VPS I've rented on OVH but decided to dropped it since it requires lots of $ROSE token to break even the cost.\n\nI've tried to look at the projects that would let community do some stress testing on their network and at the same time it gives you a reward. This project was one of it.

A good recent case study is the creation of the Genopets video tutorial explaining the project, which has almost 9,000 views to date. I also have a small portfolio on creating infographics, that's not all of course, but a small part - https://www.behance.net/gallery/129486867/Portfolio . I'm happy to create such and similar images, which mainly carry educational information about the project and help newcomers navigate. I have extensive experience in testing protocols, an active participant testnets, happy to find bugs and notify the project team about them. This experience is also good because I used to work in QA as a manual tester, so for me finding bugs, logging and process of finding bugs only pleasure.
